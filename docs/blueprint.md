# **App Name**: Civic Anomaly Detector

## Core Features:

- Intuitive Reporting: Provide a user-friendly interface for reporting urban anomalies with an intuitive design focused on simplicity and ease of use. Implement HTML, CSS, JS, or React for an improved frontend interface connected to a Flask backend for real-time interaction. Include user-friendly features like file upload forms, progress indicators, and error handling.
- AI-Powered Detection: Use AI image recognition as a tool to pre-identify anomalies from uploaded photos to streamline the reporting process.
- Automated Geotagging: Automatically geotag reports using GPS for accurate location mapping of incidents.
- Community Transparency: Display reported issues on a public feed, offering a list view to promote community awareness.
- Real-Time Feedback: Provide status updates on submitted reports, such as 'received', 'in progress', or 'resolved'.
- Ensure Accessibility: Enable access through screen readers, voice command, and customizable display options.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 65%, 50%) to RGB(#3FA3F2) – a clear, calming blue to evoke trust and civic responsibility.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) to RGB(#F0F5FA) – a very light blue to maintain a bright, clean, and modern aesthetic.
- Accent color: HSL(240, 50%, 50%) to RGB(#6A72E1) – a deep indigo used sparingly to draw attention to key interactive elements without overwhelming the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a modern and accessible look.
- Use flat, minimalist icons that visually represent each type of civic anomaly (e.g., pothole, streetlight).
- Incorporate subtle transitions and feedback animations (micro-interactions) to provide a smooth, intuitive user experience.
- Employ a grid-based layout for content alignment and clear separation of sections on the screen.
